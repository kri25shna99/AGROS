Developed a full stack application with Django framework, Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms for farmers who can sell their products to customer at their own fixed rate rather than the rate fixed by government and can help resolving the current farmers riots in India. The website includes features like E-commerce marketplace for farmer crops selling and buying, crop disease detection, weather prediction, crop recommendation system and weather alert SMS system.
